Some resources for bare-metal Raspberry Pi development.

rpi_OK_led.c blinks the OK LED on an RPi 1 Model B+.

kernel.elf is the correctly compiled LED blinker script. You will need other files to boot the Pi, placed in the first partition of a FAT formatted SD card.

This might be improved in the future.
